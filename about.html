      <h1>About Attolloo</h1>
      <p>
        Attolloo Group is a personally driven Nordic platform for leadership, AI and regulatory transformation.
        It is not a traditional consultancy, but a long-term lab for exploring how technology, regulation and human
        development can be combined in practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The work spans advisory, leadership development, strategic sparring and carefully curated arenas such as
        <em>Attolloo Polaris</em> in the Nordic mountains and <em>Attolloo Lumina</em> in a Southern light context.
      </p>

      <h2>Polaris and Lumina</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Attolloo Polaris</strong> is inspired by the Nordic mountains – a setting for leadership reflection, resilience and team dynamics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Attolloo Lumina</strong> is inspired by Southern light and long-term perspective – a context for more strategic, future-oriented
        work on personal and organisational direction.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Both concepts are being developed gradually, with the same foundation: real work, real conversations, and a strong link to
        everyday leadership challenges in complex organisations.
