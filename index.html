          <h3>Leadership in complex and regulated environments</h3>
          <p>
            How to build culture, capacity and execution power when regulation, risk and technology all matter.
            From silos to collaboration. From compliance-as-burden to compliance-as-capability.

          <h3>AI, RegTech &amp; market disruption</h3>
          <p>
            Artificial intelligence and regulatory change are now reshaping entire markets.
            Attolloo explores how organisations can use AI and RegTech to strengthen insight, control and value creation – not only to “tick the box”.
